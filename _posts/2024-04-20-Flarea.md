# Introduction

Flarea is a (currently) basic game engine that supports lua scripting, asset managing via json, and basic 3d rendering via OpenGL. It is now fairly basic - many more features will be added to it in the future.

For github repository, see [ARessegetesStery/Flarea](https://github.com/ARessegetesStery/flarea). [Here](https://youtu.be/S_wxevbJd7Y) is a basic demonstration for the engine (as a final project for course [EECS498-007](https://eecs498.com/) in University of Michigan (2024 Winter)).

# Dependencies

The project currently uses the following external dependencies:

- [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) & [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for OpenGL importing. The project used [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) for 2D rendering in its early stages, but now its usage has been deprecated as I am focusing more on 3D rendering.
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for mathematical support.
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for logging.
- [lua](https://www.lua.org/) & [luabridge](https://github.com/vinniefalco/LuaBridge) for scripting support
- [rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) for `json` file loading. I am planning to replace this with some other library as it seems to be no longer under proper/in-time maintenance (e.g. does not support c++20 well, although [this recent commit](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/commit/5ec44fb9206695e5293f610b0a46d21851d0c966) seems to be fixing the issue... needs testing)
