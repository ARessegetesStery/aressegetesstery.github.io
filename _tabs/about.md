Hi this is ARessegetes Stery. You can call me simply Arias. 

## Academia

I am interested in computer graphics, in all three branches of this subject (rendering, geometry processing and simulation). To me, this is the branch in computer science that is the closest to art, and I actually get to know this subject when trying to make something good in Unreal Engine. I am planning to write a blog to share this story :)

I am also awed by Math, which is a subject of great variety and inspiration (but I am not that good at it T_T). [Here](https://github.com/ARessegetesStery/Course-Notes) are the notes that I have taken when learning some of the subjects.

## Music

This is *the* art form that I found myself easiest to get hands on, and make progresses. I cannot count how many times music remind me of the meaning and beauty of life. 

I am myself an amateurish producer, trying to create and disperse beauty with my own hands. You can find my works in [Netease]() (all of them, but some are of low quality/results of practice) and [Bandcamp]() (selective ones, the tracks that I am proud of). I will be very happy if any of my works have any positive influence on your life - even just a little bit. That suffices to justify the meaning of art.
